#  Two files uploaded; phenotypic data and genotypic data files.

#  File description:
#  1. phenotypic Data File
Contains 5,430 accesions evaluated for seed composition over a total of 18 variables.

Samples reported upon are from the USDA Germplasm Collection based in Urbana, IL. 
Soybean samples were scanned by NIR at the University of Minnesota's Soybean Breeding 
Project laboratory. Whole soybean samples received from USDA-NASS were first ground and 
then scanned on a FOSS 6500 NIR Instrument. NIR Spectra from the FOSS 6500 were predicted 
using ISIPredict Software version 1.10.2.4842. Calibrations, provided by FOSS North 
America, were used to predict soybean composition from the NIR spectra. 

#  2. Genotypic Data File
Contains 34,706 SNP markers polymorphic among 5,430 diverse soybean accessions at the 
5 % MAF threshold.
Preliminary analyses, based on hierarchical clustering on principal components, shows 
the data to be highly clustered with about 10 subgroups. The basis of the clustering 
pattern observed is still under investigation

One aim of this study could be to investigate how clustering affects prediction.To do this, 
we can hypothesize that within cluster predictions are more accurate than predictions when
the data is treated as unclustered i.e. uniform throughout.

#  We can test different models (e.g. 3 models if each writes a model) and then test 
which model performs best and whether or not pooling the best performing models is better 
than choosing a single best performing model
#  Hypothesis: pooling best performing models gives better results than any of the models
evaluated independently
   
#  Model performance can be judged based on; 1) prediction accuracy, 2) different diagnostics
we learned in class e.g. comparisons of the posterior distributions and the data distbn.
   
# General ideas to ponder and agree on when we next meet:
1. should we predict on just a few variables or all the 18?
2. should we adopt a 75% to 25% ratio of the training set and prediction set; if yes, should
should we predict on the whole data set interchangeably?
